            The land of forts, Jaisalmer, located in the state of Rajasthan in India, stays true to its essence of royal luxury, which can be enjoyed with a Jaisalmer tour package. Loosely translated, it means ‘the Hill Fort of Jaisal’ and is located in the Western Indian Frontier. This desert city is golden hued in appearance with a heavy shade of royalty, as can be experienced with the Jaisalmer packages. The city appears almost golden along the desert due to the use of yellow sandstone in the construction of buildings! This historic fort city of Rajasthan, is known for its deserts as it stands in the heart of the Thar.History and geo-politics have left marks in the sands of Jaisalmer, colouring up this fort city over the years, across time and space. Jaisalmer’s strategic relevance to geo-politics has seen it mushroom over the recent years with military installations and well-defined, well-connected roads, making it accessible which is a big boost for tourism
            <em>The majestic fort of Jaisalmer is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is the most important tourist attraction as could be experienced within the Jodhpur Jaisalmer tour packages. But there is more to Jaisalmer than the fort.</em>
